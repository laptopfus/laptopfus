Hi, 

My name is Paweł Książek and this is my GitHub space. My nickname that most of my friends is Laptop :-D

I’m a game developer who originally started in Poland but now I work in Ubisoft Annecy. Currently, I am learning C sharp and having fun in Unreal 5. I have worked professionally in different engines, so it is cool to get to know this amazing engine. 
I’m looking to collaborate on Anything games-related. My specialization in game dev is Technical Desing but I started as Level Designer. 

You can reach me by email: laptopfus@gmail.com

Cheers,

Laptop
